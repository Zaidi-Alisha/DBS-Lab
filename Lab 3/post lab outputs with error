ORA-02436: date or system variable wrongly specified in CHECK constraint

https://docs.oracle.com/error-help/db/ora-02436/02436. 00000 -  "date or system variable wrongly specified in CHECK constraint"
*Cause:    An attempt was made to use a date constant or system variable,
           such as USER, in a check constraint that was not completely
           specified in a CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statement.  For
           example, a date was specified without the century.
*Action:   Completely specify the date constant or system variable.
           Setting the event 10149 allows constraints like "a1 > '10-MAY-96'",
           which a bug permitted to be created before version 8.

ORA-00942: table or view does not exist

https://docs.oracle.com/error-help/db/ora-00942/00942. 00000 -  "table or view%s does not exist"
*Cause:    The specified table or view did not exist, or a synonym
           pointed to a table or view that did not exist.
           To find existing user tables and views, query the
           ALL_TABLES and ALL_VIEWS data dictionary views. Certain
           privileges may be required to access the table. If an
           application returned this message, then the table that the
           application tried to access did not exist in the database, or
           the application did not have access to it.
*Action:   Check each of the following
           - The spelling of the table or view name is correct.
           - The referenced table or view name does exist.
           - The synonym points to an existing table or view.

SQL Error: ORA-00933: SQL command not properly ended

https://docs.oracle.com/error-help/db/ora-00933/00933. 00000 -  "unexpected keyword at or near %s"
*Cause:    An unexpected keyword was encountered in the SQL statement at
           or near the position printed in the error message.
           One of the following occurred:
           1. You had a typo in your SQL statement.
           2. Unsupported syntax was encountered for a clause in the
           statement.
           3. An unsupported clause was encountered in the statement.
           4. A string was terminated prematurely leading to the rest
           of the string to be interpreted as keywords. For example, an
           apostrophe in the string may be causing it to
           end prematurely.
*Action:   Take the action that corresponds with the Cause
           1. Check that your SQL statement has no typos.
           2. Check Oracle Database documentation to find the
           correct syntax for the clause and update the problematic
           clause appropriately.
           3. Check Oracle Database documentation to find the correct
           syntax for the statement and remove the unsupported clause.
           4. Enter two single quotes instead of one to represent an
           apostrophe within a string.
*Params:   1) keyword_value
           keyword near the keyword causing the error. The keyword value
           may be truncated for readability if it is too long.
